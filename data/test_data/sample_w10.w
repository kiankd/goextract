# This is an example of a file that gives exactly the same
# results as when using w=10 as an integer. Mainly here for sanity check.
# Top is left, bottom is right. Top will always be reversed when encoded.
# e.g., it'll look like 0.1, 0.2 ... 1, TERM, 1, 0.9, 0.8, ... 0.1
1.0 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1
1.0 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1
